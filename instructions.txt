Colombian Arepas

Ingredients
Original recipe (1X) yields 6 servings
1 cup warm water
1 cup pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.)
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
cooking spray

Directions
Step 1
Mix water, cornmeal, mozzarella cheese, butter, and salt together in a large bowl. Knead until well combined and a soft dough forms. Form dough into balls the size of a medium orange. Place each ball between two sheets of plastic wrap and flatten with a rolling pin to the desired thickness.

Step 2
Leaving plastic wrap in place, press the top edge of a cereal bowl or drinking glass into the surface of the dough to cut circles. Remove the plastic wrap and remove any excess dough scraps.

Step 3
Spray a griddle with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook arepas on the hot griddle until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Serve immediately.
